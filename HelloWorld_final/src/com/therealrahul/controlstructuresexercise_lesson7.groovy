//Control Structures

/* We used a class similar to this in a previous exercise but I think it's a short and sweet example of what we need to review in this exercise. 

Create An Account Class
create a property of type BigDecimal called balance with an initial value of 0.0
Create a method called deposit
use a conditional structure (if would work great here) to check if the amount being passed is less than zero. If it is we should catch this case because we don't want to deposit negative numbers. 
In this case, throw an exception.

Create another method called deposit that takes a list of amounts
use a for loop to loop over these amounts and call deposit
Now that we have our class let's test it out. You can do all of this in the same file (just don't create a file called Account.groovy) 
Create an instance of the account class
deposit a valid amount
deposit an invalid amount (what happens?)
try / catch on invalid amounts
deposit a list of amounts.

class Account { 

    BigDecimal balance = 0.0 
    
    def deposit(BigDecimal amount) { 
        if (amount < 0) { 
             throw new Exception("Deposit amount must be greater than 0.00")
        } 
        balance += amount 
    }
    
    def deposit(List amounts) { 
        for (amount in amounts) { 
            deposit(amount)
        } 
    } 
}

Account checking = new Account()
checking.deposit(20)
println checking.balance 

try { 
    checking.deposit(-1)
} catch (Exception e){ 
    println e.message
} 

println checking.balance

checking.deposit([1, 5, 10, 2])
println checking.balance
